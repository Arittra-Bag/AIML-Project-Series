# AIML-Project-Series

This project, consisting of two individual chatbots and a Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning, was developed during my tenure as a Machine Learning Intern at Nexus. These chatbots leverage the Generative Language API and Google Search API to provide information and answer user queries. As for the latter, it utilizes a RandomForestClassifier to predict diseases based on symptoms provided by the user. Feel free to explore my Disease Prediction System and use my chatbots!

## Setup and Usage

Refer to the individual README.md files within each project folder for setup instructions and detailed information about how to use the chatbots or the Disease Prediction System.
