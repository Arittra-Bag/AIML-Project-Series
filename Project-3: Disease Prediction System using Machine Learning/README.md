# Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning. It utilizes a RandomForestClassifier to predict diseases based on symptoms provided by the user.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is available in two files:

- `Training.csv`: Contains the training data with symptoms and corresponding diseases.
- `Testing.csv`: Contains the testing data for evaluating the model.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn ipywidgets
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab where you want to run the system.

2. Run the interactive dropdown interface. Select at least 3 symptoms, and view the predicted disease. Please note that providing more symptoms may result in more accurate predictions.
```
P.S: You can get the documented code from Project-3.ipynb
```

## Disclaimer

This system is for educational purposes only. The predictions made by the model are based on the provided dataset and may not be accurate in a real-world scenario. Consult a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment. The developer is not responsible for any wrong predictions or actions taken based on the predictions.
